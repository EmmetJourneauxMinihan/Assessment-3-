      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>ParKd is a motorcycle parking app aiming to provide both free and paid parking solutions to all two wheeled commuters within Sydney. The app will be community rated, meaning that residents can provide a two-wheeler parking location on the app, which they feel is secure and safe. The concept of this app is to mitigate the time wasted on searching and locating a safe and secure parking spot. Using geo location, the app will provide suggestions for the closest and safest community rated parking near a chosen location. ParKd goes beyond just finding spots, it allows riders to ‘reserve’ a parking they wish to occupy. Using ParKd will also save money on fuel, as it can show the user exactly where the vacant spots are, reducing the usual time and fuel wasted on finding a parking spot. ParKd will also allows users to pay through the phone, allowing instant payments and reservations. PayPal, direct deposit, and other payment methods are all available through the app. </br><br> ParKd offers the user two options when using the app: the choice of either being a rider or a host. Riders are simply those in the community using the app to seek a parking spot for their two-wheeled vehicle. Hosts, on the other hand, are those people who are using the app to either ‘rent out’ their garage, driveway, or any free parking space. These ‘rented out’ spaces will be called bays, or hubs.</p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>Currently in Australia, there is a major problem regarding motorbike parking, Sydney itself amounting to almost 1200 thefts in the last 12 months, as shown by NMVTRC. It is especially concerning that more than half of the victims of motorbike theft never see their bikes again. As a result of this, we wanted to develop an application through which motorcyclists could easily find, rent, and occupy parking spaces. We plan to create a safer parking environment for those who ride motorcycles. It is a rapid growing problem in Australia, especially in Sydney, which has the highest rate of motorbike in thefts in all of Australia, and many innocent people are suffering from this selfish act and needs to be solved immediately. With this app, we aspire to minimize, or even eradicate, these horrific theft rates, putting an end to one of Australia’s biggest problems. </p>

      <h2>Landscape</h2>
      <p>Currently, there aren’t many reliable motorbike parking apps out in the market. There are only a handful of applications in this category, and a few websites that show available parking spots for motorcycles. According to RACQ, there are eight reliable and popular apps that show motorbike parking availability, and they are:</br></br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cheap Parking</li>
        <li>Parkopedia: Known for finding cheap street parking</li>
        <li>Parkhound: Known for finding best daily parking</li>
        <li>ParkMe Parking (INRIX): Known for best parking app in Brisbane</li>
        <li>Kerb</li>
        <li>PayByPhone</li>
        <li>PayStay: Known for finding best metered street parking</li>
        <li>CellOPark: Known for finding best metered street parking</li>
      </ul>
      <p></br>Although these apps are readily available and useful, they only house one or two features within, for example, the app is known for metered parking, or cheap parking. This is where we want to separate our app from the rest, we want to house all those features, ranging from costly and free parking, to renting out vacant spots for parking. This app will be unique, as there is yet to be an all-rounder motorbike parking app in Australia. </p>

      <h2>Aim</h2>
      <p>The aim for this project, as mentioned in the Topic section. Is to provide motorcyclists with safe and timely parking for their vehicles throughout the day. One of the biggest problems with riding a motorbike in Sydney is that so much bike theft and damage happens on a day-to-day basis. We aim to create a platform for riders to rent out safe spaces such when they aren’t using it for themselves.<br><br>
        We want to allow riders to rent parking spaces off others and be assured that their vehicle will remain safe for the few hours it spends at a location. Our solution to this is to allow other riders to rent out their spaces while they are gone for the day. This way, safe parking throughout Sydney will not be going to waste and will almost always be in use.<br><br>
        For this kind of project to work we must assume that our users want to look after their community and won’t be using this application maliciously. We can further ensure bike safety by having users sign an agreement that says that all private parking spaces must also provide video surveillance. Further ensuring the safety of our users.<br><br>
        ParKd should also provide an easy way for its users to find this parking. Our main idea for this is to provide our users with the ability to browse an interactive map in a certain area of Sydney and have available parking spaces show up on the map with a price. Similar to how hotel booking applications work. </p>

<section id="roles">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="light">
      <h2>Roles</h2>
      <p>Due to each of our members having to commit to different schedules and having changes to availability from week to week. Our group found it so much more effective to just leave our roles as dynamic and have the tasks that need to be done get completed on an ‘as needed’ and ‘when you can’ basis.
      <br><br>The biggest hurdle that we had to get over from beginning to end was the availability of each group member. Let us provide an example of what could happen with defined roles.
      <br><br>There are four group members, for the sake of example let's call them Person A, Person B, and so forth.
      <br><br>Person A has to complete the task of writing multiple sections of the document so that Person C can review, Person D can implement it into the prototype, and Person B can add it to the website. However, Person A doesn’t have availability or access to a computer for the next 3 days.
      <br><br>It’s easy to see here how one person's circumstances can delay an entire process by 3 whole days, which, in a project which requires as much effort as this one. This could be very detrimental to the entire group.
      <br><br>So instead, we opted to have the tasks listed in planner, and have our group members take the tasks that they would have completed in that time period. This way it was easier to keep track of doing what, and, since deadlines were already set for each section, we were able to get things done with each member of the group contributing as much as they can.
      <br><br>Using this approach to getting the work done, each member ended up writing their own sections of the document, Taylor ended up doing the website, Saajid and Emmet worked on the prototype and Sam worked on getting backend functions up and running. But it’s also worth mentioning that other members of the group helped out with other parts, so while Taylor may have been working on the website, the other 3 members had inputs for things that could change and were able to update their own personal profile sections in the HTML. Or while Emmet and Saajid were working on the prototyping in Figma, Taylor and Sam also had their own input and even helped make their own screens to be used as examples of what they thought would be a good approach to achieve what we were trying to achieve.</p>

      <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
      <p>ParKd was initiated to address motorcycle parking problems within the Sydney Area by creating a two wheeled parking solutions app. Our key objective is to automate and decrease the time spent manually searching for optimal parking near a chosen location. The function of the application is to provide a user-friendly interface with three steps.  <br><br>Step1# Searching – the rider types in their desired location, ParKd will suggest the closest free and hosted parking to the chosen Location
      <br><br>Step2# Route planning, this is an important feature to address arrival and departure times holding true to our key objective.
      <br><br>Step3# ParKd, the arrival the rider simply parks either in the free or paid hosted bay at said location.
      <br><br>There will be a corresponding web application whereby anyone using the app can log in to view <br><br>

<section id="tools-technologies">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="light">
      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <h3>Web Server/IIS/Apache Server:</h3>
      <p>Windows have service called IIS or Internet Information Services that can be added as a feature in Windows Server/10/7 etc. which can host websites in the intranet or internet. For Linux, we can use Apache server. It is open source and free to use. It can run on Windows too. XAMPP is also a good tool for hosting website. It has a graphical interface for SQL, so it is a good tool for RDBMS. </p>

      <h3>DNS (Private/Public)</h3>
      <p>DNS is a translator in simple words, it translates a domain name into an IP address. It can be private, or it can be public. Mostly private DNS are used for intranets. Public DNS is used for internet. Such as: 8.8.8.8 (Google), No-IP, DynDNS etc. For name resolution: we can use a static Public IP address or No-IP/DynDNS. DynDNS or No-IP simply keeps a record of updated public IP address, after the lease ends. So, when the domain name is resolves, it gets the updated IP and routed to the host. </p>

      <h3>RDBMS</h3>
      <p>Also known as Relational Database Management System. Such as: SQL, MySQL, DB2 etc. MS Access is also RDBMS. However, it cannot manage large quantities of cells like SQL can. So, for a software like ParKd needs to have SQL database at least. Tools for RDBMS are Azure Data Studio (Hybrid), MS SQL server, XAMPP etc.  <br>
      [<b>NB.</b> SQL can hold 524 Petabytes of data at the maximum]  </p>

      <h3>FTP Server</h3>
      <p>We can get the FTP service from the windows feature. It is under the Internet Information Services. In simple words, FTP is used for accessing a folder remotely. Permission can vary for user to user. Such as: Read-only, Change and Full control.  </p>

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>Python is versatile and flexible. It is a high-level language. We can write modules and import modules on-demand.
      <ul>
        <li> <b>PyQRCode:</b> Generates QR code </li>
        <li> <b>Cryptography:</b> Fernet, SHA256, SHA512, etc. </li>
        <li> <b>OpenCV:</b> Can use a camera module to identify objects. The module we will use, will be able to resolve QR code to alphanumeric values.</li>
        <li> <b>GeoPy:</b> Can get the geolocation, nearest location and farthest location </li>
        <li> <b>SMTPlib:</b> Can send emails</li>
        <li> <b>Kivy: </b>A Python framework created for the purpose of creating apps in Python. </li>
      </ul>
     </p>

     <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
     <p>These are used for creating a document designed to be displayed on the browser. CSS is used for formatting the layout of a webpage.  </p>

     <h3>CLI/.bat/.sh/.ps1:</h3>
     <p>Also known as Command Line Prompt. It is another version of GUI or Graphical User Interface. CLI consumes less resources, CLI can be often faster than GUI. CLI is extremely useful when it comes to automation. We can also use CLI to deploy a script in a group of computers. In simple words, we can write bunch of commands in a batch file, shell script or PowerShell script and run them on a machine.</p>

     <h3>HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, TLS</h3>
     <p>HTTP is a protocol that is user for transmitting the webpages and other files. HTTPS functions similarly but it encrypts all communications between the server and the end user. For example, if we log into “http://www.login.com” using user = “tess” and password = “secret1234”, the communication will be in plain text. Anyone can see the credentials, using a packet analyzer such as: Wireshark. But if it is “https://www.login.com,” then the credentials will be encrypted before the credentials are transferred. So, even if there is MITM attack, the hacker can only see the encrypted version of the password, which is extremely difficult to decrypt as credentials will be using one way hash function.  <br><br>
    To enable HTTPS, we need to install an SSL/TLS certificate. <br><br> </p>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="dark">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>We will know if we have succeeded with this project when all functions are operational and working as expected. So far, we have run tests with the prototype in Figma, asking friends to view the prototype and give their feedback and opinion. We're really happy with how the prototype is looking now and the usability testing went really well. There were a few issues early on but they were quickly fleshed out. In terms of testing the backend, this has been done as we're going along. While Sam has been creating functions in python he has also been testing that they're all working as expecting, and testing connectivity in some cases. <br><br>
      When the frontend has had significant development, the plan is to go back to random users and get them to test again. These tests will again, test the usability and intuitiveness of our application. When a user tests our program we can provide them with a 3 or 4 question survey so that they can provide feeback. such as:<br><br> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate the usablity of this application?</li>
        <li>on a scale of 1-5 how likely are you to use this application for yourself?</li>
        <li>Any feedback you'd like to provide the developers?</li>
      </ul> <br><br>
      <p>Another method that we may use for user testing is to simply let users play around with an early version of our app and just observe. See what they struggle with, see what they like. Ask the user to think out loud so we can gain a better understanding of how someone picking up this application for the first time might react to it. <br><br>
      We can also use this frontend testing to ensure that the frontend is communcating properly with the backend. If we ask users to create test accounts, we'd be able to heck if that users details are being filled out on all the relevant tables. <br><br>
    The important thing is that we flesh out as many issues as possible, with the use of user testing we are able to do this and in terms of the backend we are able to ensure that the program doesn't bring up any errors and that information is being stored where its supposed to. <br> </p>

      <h2>Risks</h2>
      <p>There are quite a few risks that should be considered heading into a project like this. To name a few:
      <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficulty learning relevant libraries to make this app come to life</li>
      <li>Time constraints</li>
      <li>User Error, People not checking out of parking spots, people not keeping their own parking spots updated, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    The first thing we need to consider is that this app could be a lot more difficult to create than we anticipate. It is all well and good that we’re all comfortable with writing code to create programs, but as for any experience each of us have creating an application from start to finish, none of us have the full stack of skills required to make this come to life. Which will inevitably lead to a time crunch toward the expected end date of this project. With the timelines that we are given, honestly, it is unrealistic to have this project complete from start to finish in the allocated time.
    <br><br>
    It is entirely possible that each member of our group spends so much time and energy learning how to create these types of things that by time we feel ready to start working on it, it could be weeks or months down the line. At the very least we are comfortable with creating a prototype with tools available to RMIT students such as Figma, but beyond that our skills are limited.
    <br><br>
    Figuring out a bunch of different Python libraries to make an app can be time consuming and, you do not know exactly how each function works until you have applied it to something and seen it in action
    <br><br>
    Another risk that comes along with the creation of an application such as this one is that there is always going to be room for user error. We need to consider every possibility. It might even be worth getting some users to test out our high-fidelity prototype and make sure that the design of the application is intuitive.
    <br><br>
    It is probable that users are going to forget to check out of parking spots or say they will be renting a parking spot from someone else for 1 hour and exceed that time limit. A workaround for problems such as these would be to send a notification to the person's phone asking if they will have left by the expected time or if they need to add 15 minutes to their booking.
