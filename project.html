      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>ParKd is a motorcycle parking app aiming to provide both free and paid parking solutions to all two wheeled commuters within Sydney. The app will be community rated, meaning that residents can provide a two-wheeler parking location on the app, which they feel is secure and safe. The concept of this app is to mitigate the time wasted on searching and locating a safe and secure parking spot. Using geo location, the app will provide suggestions for the closest and safest community rated parking near a chosen location. ParKd goes beyond just finding spots, it allows riders to ‘reserve’ a parking they wish to occupy. Using ParKd will also save money on fuel, as it can show the user exactly where the vacant spots are, reducing the usual time and fuel wasted on finding a parking spot. ParKd will also allows users to pay through the phone, allowing instant payments and reservations. PayPal, direct deposit, and other payment methods are all available through the app. </br><br> ParKd offers the user two options when using the app: the choice of either being a rider or a host. Riders are simply those in the community using the app to seek a parking spot for their two-wheeled vehicle. Hosts, on the other hand, are those people who are using the app to either ‘rent out’ their garage, driveway, or any free parking space. These ‘rented out’ spaces will be called bays, or hubs.</p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>Currently in Australia, there is a major problem regarding motorbike parking, Sydney itself amounting to almost 1200 thefts in the last 12 months, as shown by NMVTRC. It is especially concerning that more than half of the victims of motorbike theft never see their bikes again. As a result of this, we wanted to develop an application through which motorcyclists could easily find, rent, and occupy parking spaces. We plan to create a safer parking environment for those who ride motorcycles. It is a rapid growing problem in Australia, especially in Sydney, which has the highest rate of motorbike in thefts in all of Australia, and many innocent people are suffering from this selfish act and needs to be solved immediately. With this app, we aspire to minimize, or even eradicate, these horrific theft rates, putting an end to one of Australia’s biggest problems. </p>

      <h2>Landscape</h2>
      <p>Currently, there aren’t many reliable motorbike parking apps out in the market. There are only a handful of applications in this category, and a few websites that show available parking spots for motorcycles. According to RACQ, there are eight reliable and popular apps that show motorbike parking availability, and they are:</br></br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cheap Parking</li>
        <li>Parkopedia: Known for finding cheap street parking</li>
        <li>Parkhound: Known for finding best daily parking</li>
        <li>ParkMe Parking (INRIX): Known for best parking app in Brisbane</li>
        <li>Kerb</li>
        <li>PayByPhone</li>
        <li>PayStay: Known for finding best metered street parking</li>
        <li>CellOPark: Known for finding best metered street parking</li>
      </ul>
      <p></br>Although these apps are readily available and useful, they only house one or two features within, for example, the app is known for metered parking, or cheap parking. This is where we want to separate our app from the rest, we want to house all those features, ranging from costly and free parking, to renting out vacant spots for parking. This app will be unique, as there is yet to be an all-rounder motorbike parking app in Australia. </p>
