          <h3>Taylor</h3>
          <p class="lead">I grew up in a small Victorian town called Camperdown where I attended school at Mercy Regional College. This is where I met a lot of my friends, who I still talk to and hang out with on a regular basis. I've got a little over 2 years of experience working in IT support and am currently doing a full-time IT Project Management Traineeship which will get me a Certificate IV in business.</p>
          <p class="lead">As far as hobbies go, the main ones to include would be weightlifting, guitar, and a little bit of gaming. I've also been dabbling in a bit of 3D modelling lately using blender which has been really fun.</p> </br></br>
          <h4>Personality Tests</h4>

          </br><b>Colour Works Style Discovery:</b> Motivator
        </br><b>Mumford Honey Learning Style:</b> Activist </b> </br></br>
        I will need to be careful and considerate when sharing my opinions with the other members of the group. The ‘16 Personalities’ test gave me some insight as to what my personality types' biggest strengths and weaknesses are, from the extensive list I chose the two that I felt were most applicable to myself, those being ‘perceptive’ and ‘insensitive’ respectively. ​

        To work effectively in a group setting, it is important that I keep the other group members’ emotions in mind. On the other hand, me being perceptive could come in very handy for our group. If a situation were to arise where we were not sure if we had completed all the requirements of the assignment, it is possible that I would be able to notice that something is missing.

        <p class="lead">I have lived worked and studied in a verity of different locations and cities from Cork Ireland to Sydney Australia. I finished my high school education in West Cork, Ireland in 2008 where I embarked on a creative path exploring audio production through initially S.I.T Invercargill, New Zealand and then SAE London, England. My interest in information technology stems from two elements, firstly my comfort level with using technology and secondly my discomfort with a lack of deep understanding and implementation of this technology. </p>
        <p class="lead">I enjoy spending my free time, playing Spanish guitar, perusing art galleries, engaging in team sports football (soccer) and rowing.</p>

TheMyer-Briggs ‘16Personalities’ test results helpedme distinguish my biggest strengths ofbeing self-confident, strong-willed, energetic, efficient,strategic thinker as well as myweaknesses being intolerant, impatient, stubborn anddominant. My colour result waspurple “reformer type’ which identified that I wouldhave difficulty working with green‘helper types’ luckily no one in our group had thispersonality type. My learning style results6
      Reflector/Pragmatist showed that I would need to observe and reflect to be able to put thelearning obtained into practice.

        <p class="lead">I grew up and lived in Queensland for 10 years, before moving to Sydney. My family's background is from Fiji.</p>
        <p class="lead">I have very little IT knowledge; however, I am currently studying at RMIT University, doing an IT course, hopefully to become more knowledgeable in the IT field.</p>
        <p class="lead">My main hobbies would be soccer and MMA, which is mixed martial arts.</p>

     The three personality tests were a great way for me to understand myself better and helped me figure out what I would need to change for me to work with my group, or any other group, productively. The '16 Personalities' showed me that my weaknesses mainly revolved around selflessness. While being selfless could be a good quality at times, at most, it could cause the downfall of my own work, if I pay too much attention to others. From that same test though, I was shown my main strengths, which were those of which a good group would need to have. Of them would be that I'm loyal, which means I can be relied on to complete my share of the assignment.

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p class="lead">I have worked as a network administrator and System Engineer (present) respectively. I want to enhance my knowledge on Programming, Robotics/Automation and Electronics. I also want to get my bachelor done, so I can join my dream company. I want to work in the space industry. Aviation and space have always fascinated me. However, I never wanted to be an Aeronautical Engineer or a Pilot. I like computing and IT.

In the meantime, get my bachelor done, learn writing batch files, shell scripts, PS1 scripts, etc alongside python and other languages. Try to use these skills in my workplace for practical knowledge. I believe my short-term goals will ease the transition to Automation after completion of my bachelor.</p>

<h2>Common Elements:</h2>
<p class="lead">There are some common elements included in our career plans. As mentioned above we have all concluded that tertiary education is a good starting point for accomplishing the goals which we have laid out for ourselves. But there are more common elements than just that. Take for example, we are all looking at getting into <b>some</b> kind of software development, whether it be game design, web development, or robotics. Each one of us has an interest in problem solving and that really shined through while working on our project.</p>

<h2>Career Plans:</h2>
<p class="lead">As mentioned above, there exists a certain number of similarities among our group where each member of the group would like to end up. As far as career plans go, we each understand that completing some form of tertiary study would be the most straight-forward path to getting where we need to go. Each member of our group understands that all necessary skills will need to be practiced in order to land our ideal jobs, and we understand that there are many methods to go about this, whether it be formal, informal or incidental learning.</p>

      <h2><i>For this project, we are going to be learning and making use of the following tools:</i></h2>
      <p class="lead">
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Windows Server 2012r2 or 2016</h3>for services such as IIS and DNS</li>
        <li><h3>Spyder IDE and Python + libraries such as PyQRCode, Cryptography (Fernet), Opencv-python, Geopy</h3>for writing backend code, more libraries are available for creating apps, so python can also be used to write the fronten code.</li>
        <li><h3>Azure Data Studio</h3>Which will be used for all our database needs. When used in conjunction with python this will make for neat and accessible databases</li>
        <li><h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>Used for communications between group memebers and organising/attending group meetings.</li>
        <li><h3>Figma</h3>Used for prototyping our application 'ParKd'</li>
        <li> <h3>Microsoft Office Online</h3>Used for collaboration when creating the report. Office online allows for easier collaboration. </li>
        <li> <h3>Microsoft Planner (within teams)</h3>Was used to keep track of outstanding tasks and due dates. </li>
        <li>  <h3>Whiteboard</h3>Used for better explaining ideas and evaluating options/ideas. </li>
        <li> <h3>Basic Router and SmartPhone</h3>For testing purposes </li>
        <li> <h3>VMware</h3>to setup virtual machines and use for testing functionalities. </li>
        <li> <h3>No-IP or DyDNS</h3>Easiest way to make the application support online features. </li>
      </ul>
    </br>

      <h2><b>Group Processes</b></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Our group had a high level of collaboration throughout assessment two. But we all acknowledged that there was need for improvements here and there. For starters, we concluded that proper use of the project planner would be extremely beneficial to what we were trying to achieve, we assigned tasks to each member of our group using this planner and as a result of this we were easily able to assign roles to different members.​ </br></br>

We also included the use of polls, to work out when each member of our group was available and so that we can schedule meetings to suit everyone's availability. On top of this, we also increased the frequency of meetings so that group members could have more time to discuss with other members.​ </br></br>

A more effective use of collaborative tools has also been implemented. We are now collaboratively working on documents through Microsoft teams AND Office online.
