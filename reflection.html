        <p> In the end, I think that this assessment turned out to be a pretty good effort, all things considered. However, I think that the way that our group managed its time could be improved such as to avoid such a big rush toward the final hours leading up to the deadline. I was surprised at how well our group managed to get along, and the fact that there were no conflicts leading up to the submission, given how different all our personalities are and the like. One thing that I’ve learned about groups is that I don’t particularly enjoy the dynamic of a group project. Having to wait on different parts to be done before you’re able to complete your own part can be quite stressful, also having other members depend on you to get things done can lead to frustrations when your own availability doesn't line up with theirs. That’s not to say that this happened in this group assignment, just an idea I already had that was reinforced towards the deadline. GitHub was not overly used throughout the course of our group assignment, only for the website.

        <p>Money can’t buy what I have learnt about teamwork from this assessment and our previous experience working together. My level of appreciation for teamwork has grown and my desire to work in collaborative projects has increased. Our group members understanding of the task at hand was questionable in parts, but never dull.
          <br><br>

I have strongly enjoyed the experience of expressing an idea and witnessing it almost come to life.

Unfortunately, as GitHub was not primarily used to assemble our groups tasks, I do not believe it will accurately reflect our group members' contributions or activity.

        <p>Working together for assignment 3 proved to be quite like assignment 2. The group was efficient in completing all the tasks needed, within a reasonable timespan. The group managed to communicate quite well with each other, keeping everyone updated on their progresses.  
          <br>

          Although the group communicated better compared to last time, there was still a lack of communication within the first 2 weeks. As a result of this lack of communication, a fair amount of productive time was lost, impacting the overall contributions to this assignment. 
          <br>

          What surprised me was that despite the time that was lost, our group still decided to stay persistent on our efforts to complete this assignment.
          <br>  

          The one thing I have learned about working in groups is that if the group does not communicate within the first few days of being assigned, the group can get quite lost, and it can affect the overall progress of the group work  </p>

        <p>My confidence in team working has increased. I was not able to finish the backend part. But I am determined to build a complete product soon. It has been an amazing experience working with some enthusiastic people. However, there were ups and downs in the team. We were not able to collaborate for quite a while. Despite many hurdles, we were able to complete the assignment. But we were able to get our work done. One thing I learnt from this assessment is that anything that we can do today, we should do today. Never leave it for tomorrow. If we could start the backend a little earlier, we could have built a full program. There have been some instances when we have demotivated each other from doing something, what they are confident of doing. Now we are aware that we should motivate each other and support each other. In this way, we can achieve our goals even if it is quite difficult. </p>

        <p>For the most part, there were definitely periods throughout this project where our group would have blips in communication, that's not to say that during these periods no work got done, it just seems like if these blips didn't exist a lot more could have been accomplished. The amount of work that we achieved all things considered is still phenomenal, none of us came into this course expecting to learn the different skills that we did, but due to the (in some cases) extreme challenges thrust upon us we were able to accomplish amazing things.</p>
